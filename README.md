# Stonly Chat Proxy (Clean Vercel)

This is a clean Vercel project for a Stonly chatbot proxy with **domain restriction**.

- Place `api/chat.js` at root `/api` folder
- Deploy to Vercel
- Set environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- Use `fetch` from your Stonly JS to `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/chat`
